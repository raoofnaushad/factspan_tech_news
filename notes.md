Facility Management: The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Overcoming Challenges

Facility management is a crucial segment of both commercial and non-commercial organizations. It involves coordinating teams, attending meetings, answering urgent emails, consulting vendors or suppliers, maintaining security, managing machinery, and more. However, the effectiveness of the organization can be negatively affected by the productivity of each individual, leading to unwanted expenses. This is where Artificial Intelligence (AI) comes in, as it can determine the areas where maximum effectiveness can be attained without extensive human involvement or related expenditure.

Several economic factors have made outsourcing more relevant for facilities management. However, the function lags behind other functions such as production equipment maintenance by both digital maturity and penetration of technology. Although technology is available for facilities management, several obstacles have inhibited adoption, such as a lack of digital skills within the function, other priorities for leadership, and a focus on continuous cost-cutting. These factors have made the facilities management outsourcing market attractive for leading vendors that were already engaged directly or indirectly with this function.

Extensive expenditure, energy utility, human error, security invadence, and the Covid-19 pandemic are some of the major issues/challenges faced by the facility management sector. The pandemic has dramatically disrupted global businesses, leading to changes in customer and third-party behavior, as well as changes in demand for products and services. Additionally, workforce unavailability due to sickness and changes in productivity due to increasing numbers of remote workers have also been observed.

However, AI can help overcome these challenges. Sensor technology and analytics can be used to monitor desk occupancy, washroom distancing, and cleaning regimes. Plus, temperature and humidity sensors improve comfort and minimize the chances of spreading the virus through air. IoT has had numerous applications during COVID-19 outbreaks, including in remote working, stock management, healthcare, and industrial manufacturing. This trend is likely to continue and evolve, as key players fine-tune their IoT devices to improve efficiency and accuracy.

Moreover, AI can help in predictive maintenance, which can reduce downtime and maintenance costs. It can also help in energy management, as it can analyze data from sensors and provide insights on energy usage patterns, leading to cost savings. AI can also help in security management, as it can analyze data from cameras and sensors to detect anomalies and alert security personnel.

In conclusion, the facility management sector can benefit greatly from the adoption of AI. It can help overcome challenges such as extensive expenditure, energy utility, human error, security invadence, and the Covid-19 pandemic. AI can help in predictive maintenance, energy management, and security management, leading to cost savings and improved efficiency. As the world becomes more digital, the facility management sector needs to embrace AI to stay competitive and relevant.
